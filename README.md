### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hello!, My name is Sebastian. I currently live in Colombia. I've been learning code for about four years now. I love making and designing phone aplications with Flutter and Kotlin (and possible JavaScript in the future).  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily acceses (that's the reason why I choosed code mobile aplications)  but at this time, I'm only focusing on improving my skills on mobile (I have plans to keep learning JS in the near future.) I love when I can finally solve a difficult problem or a challenge(even if it take's a little while).

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Dart, React Native, Clean Architecture, and Kotlin.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Q-vision Technologies as a QA Tester. I am currently looking for a change of position, so I am open to job offers. 
- ðŸ˜€ I like to write, code, read, do my Duolingo (In that aplication I improve my actual level of English), and play video games in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about anything im a very flexible persone**.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!" -> if i remember my first code line was "Hello Miau" heeh in Java
