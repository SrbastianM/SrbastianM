### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SrbastianM/SrbastianM/)

Hello!, My name is Sebastian. I currently lives in lives in the Colombia. I'm learning how to code about four years ago. I love making and designing phone aplications with Flutter and Kotlin (and possible JavaScript in the future).  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily acceses (that's the reason why I choosed code mobile aplications) . I also enjoy programming in JavaScript but in this time I only focus to improve my skills in Mobile (later I re take my learning in javaScirpt. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem (even if take's a litle while).

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Dart, React Native, Clean Architecture, and Kotlin.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Q-vision Technologies such as QA Tester (Pls get me out for this role :') .
- ðŸ˜€ I like to write, code, read, do my Duolingo (In that aplication I improve my actual level of English), and play video games in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about anything im a very flexible persone**.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!" -> if i remember my first code line was "Hello Miau" heeh in Java
