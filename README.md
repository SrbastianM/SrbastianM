### Hi there 👋

Hello!, My name is Sebastian. I currently live in Colombia. I love making and designing phone aplications with Flutter and Kotlin.  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily acceses (that's the reason why I choosed code mobile aplications).
I love when I can finally solve a difficult problem or a challenge (even if it take's a little while).

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart, Kotlin, Clean Architecture, and Native Android even while i got a job such as QA .
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Q-vision Technologies as a QA Tester. I am currently looking for a change of position, so I am open to job offers. 
- 😀 I like to write, develop mobile apps, read and play video games in my free time.
- 💬 **Ask me about anything im a very flexible persone**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!" -> if i remember my first code line was "Hello Miau" heh in Java
